# Travel-Agency-Data-Fill-and-Analysis
University project for a Travel Agency Database Filling and Analysis. The project is divided into two major parts: Data Filling and Data Analysis. The first part is about filling the database with fake, randomly generated data. For this we used the `faker` library. The second part is about analyzing the data in the database and creating reports. The project is written in Python and uses a MariaDB database. The plots are created using the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries. The database schema was visualized using `DataGrip`. The project was created in Jupyter Notebook. The project was created by a team of 4 people: [Dominik Jur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominikjur/) (me), [Albert Janik](), [Szymon Klim](), [Kacper Samulski](). The project was created as part of the Database course at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. The course was conducted by [Dr inż. Andrzej Giniewicz](https://prac.im.pwr.edu.pl/~giniew/doku.php?id=start). The project was created in the winter semester of the academic year 2024/2025. The laboratory classes were lead by [Mgr Sylwester Piątek](https://alfa.im.pwr.edu.pl/~piatek/home.html).
